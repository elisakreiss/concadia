# Models

This folder contains code used for the model experiments in the paper. We experiment with three architectures: 

- ResNet-LSTM
- DenseNet-LSTM
- OSCAR(VinVL)

The first two are implemented in `context_compat_xu2015/`; OSCAR(VinVL) is implemented in `context_compat_oscar/`. Navigate to the respective subdirectory for further details.
