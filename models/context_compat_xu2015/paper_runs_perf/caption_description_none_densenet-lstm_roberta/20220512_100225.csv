A counterweight at the upper end keeps the center of mass well above geostationary orbit level. This produces enough upward centrifugal force from Earth's rotation to fully counter the downward gravity, keeping the cable upright and taut.  Climbers carry cargo up and down the cable.","Diagram of a space elevator. At the bottom of the tall diagram is the Earth as viewed from high above the North Pole. About six earth-radii above the Earth an arc is drawn with the same center as the Earth. The arc depicts the level of geosynchronous orbit. About twice as high as the arc and directly above the Earth's center, a counterweight is depicted by a small square. A line depicting the space elevator's cable connects the counterweight to the equator directly below it. The system's center of mass is described as above the level of geosynchronous orbit. The center of mass is shown roughly to be about a quarter of the way up from the geosynchronous arc to the counterweight. The bottom of the cable is indicated to be anchored at the equator. A climber is depicted by a small rounded square. The climber is shown climbing the cable about one third of the way from the ground to the arc. Another note indicates that the cable rotates along with the Earth's daily rotation, and remains vertical.","A space elevator would consist of a cable anchored to the Earth 's surface , reaching into space ."

20220512_100225,5,47902.jpg,"IPMC actuation, energy harvesting and sensing principles. When a voltage (electric field) is applied to the electrodes, positively charged conjugated and hydrated cations in the membrane molecular network are repulsed by the anode and migrate towards the negative electrode or the cathode carrying the hydrated water molecules with them. This migration creates an osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane causing the IPMC strip to bend or deform in a spectacular manner. On the other hand, mechanically bending or deforming the IPMC strips causes the conjugated cations to move around and this creates an electric potential and output voltage and transient current (energy harvesting, sensing modes) based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck field theories. Hydrated water molecules are bonded with cations as they migrate around. However, if there are non-hydrated loose water molecules dragged with the hydrated cations as added mass towards the anode, once bending or deformation equilibrium is achieved the loose water molecules flow back towards the cathode and some back-relaxation may be observed.",IPMC actuation principle,An example of how a biological photovoltaic system .

The binding of Protein B in this example is necessary for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription.In a laboratory setting, it may not be known that the promoter consists of two regions -- single mutations can be made along the promoter, the promoter can be sequenced, and the levels of reporter assayed to find boundaries for each region.",Promoter Bashing,An example of a spectrum of a porbeagle results .
