20220322_101059,5,47902.jpg,IPMC actuation principle,"IPMC actuation, energy harvesting and sensing principles. When a voltage (electric field) is applied to the electrodes, positively charged conjugated and hydrated cations in the membrane molecular network are repulsed by the anode and migrate towards the negative electrode or the cathode carrying the hydrated water molecules with them. This migration creates an osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane causing the IPMC strip to bend or deform in a spectacular manner. On the other hand, mechanically bending or deforming the IPMC strips causes the conjugated cations to move around and this creates an electric potential and output voltage and transient current (energy harvesting, sensing modes) based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck field theories. Hydrated water molecules are bonded with cations as they migrate around. However, if there are non-hydrated loose water molecules dragged with the hydrated cations as added mass towards the anode, once bending or deformation equilibrium is achieved the loose water molecules flow back towards the cathode and some back-relaxation may be observed.",A diagram showing the stages of a volcano .

Mulders had also completed another major challenge -- the construction of a new block of class rooms for the St. Mary's Primary School for which he was the Principal. Prior to this, school and church functions were conducted in temporary, post WWII structures, mainly of timber, kajang and attap. In the absence of low-loaders in the 50's, Fr.
